 pol.1.t:0 "Sytuacja Rzeczypospolitej Obojga Narodów"
 pol.1.d:0 "The once-mighty Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth stands at a crossroads. Decades of foreign interference, internal corruption, and political paralysis have brought the Republic to the brink of collapse. Yet, hope flickers anew — the Constitution of May 3rd has breathed life into the dream of a modern, reformed state. But not all share this vision. Reactionary nobles, fearing the loss of their ancient privileges, have turned to Russia for aid, forming the Targowica Confederation. As Russian armies cross the border, the Commonwealth faces its greatest trial: to defend its newfound liberty or to succumb once again to the will of its powerful neighbors. The year is 1792 — and the destiny of Poland and Lithuania hangs in the balance."
 pol.1.a:0 "Einam"
 
 pol.2.t:0 "The Commonwealth Stands"
 pol.2.d:0 "With courage and determination, the Commonwealth has chosen not merely to resist, but to strengthen itself from within. Inspired by the Constitution of May 3rd, reformers across the land begin to shape a new era — modernizing governance, reorganizing the army, and fostering a spirit of civic pride.Though dangers still loom, the people sense a brighter future. The Republic moves forward, guided by wisdom, courage, and the hope of lasting liberty."
 pol.2.a:0 "Start Reforms"
 
 pol.3.t:0 "The New Constitution of the Commonwealth"
 pol.3.d:0 "After long debate and reflection on the perilous state of our realm, the Sejm and the Crown have at last reached agreement. The Commonwealth shall no longer endure the weight of foreign meddling and internal discord. A new Constitution is proclaimed — one that grants the government strength to act, the army power to defend, and the nation unity of purpose.Across Poland and Lithuania, bells ring and banners rise. Reformers speak of renewal, while the old guard watches with wary eyes. Yet one truth is clear: the days of weakness are past. The Commonwealth stands reformed, resolved to guard its motherland against all who would subdue it."
 pol.3.a:0 "For the strength of the motherland!"
 
 pol.5.t:0 "The Northern Question"
 pol.5.d:0 "The time has come to look once more toward the Baltic. The port of Gdynia — our gateway to the sea and symbol of lost sovereignty — lies under Prussian rule, taken during our nation’s years of weakness. Now, with the Commonwealth stirring anew, many voices within the Sejm call for its return.Our armies are not yet at full strength, and the treasury strains under the weight of reform. Yet to remain passive would invite further humiliation. The question before us is one of courage — shall we risk war to reclaim what is rightfully ours?"
 pol.5.a:0 "Prepare the plans for war!"

 france.1.t:0 "Storming The Tuileries"
 france.1.d:0 "The long reign of the French monarchy and the House of Bourbon has come to an end. Who will rise to power and fill the ever exapnding void of power within the French government?"
 france.1.a:0 "Only Time Will Tell..."
 
 france.8.t:0 "Trial Of Louis Capet"
 france.8.d:0 "The former King of France, now stripped of his titles and known only as Louis Capet, stands before the National Convention. The great hall falls silent as the charges are read - treason against the nation, conspiracy with foreign powers, and crimes against the liberty of the French people. The evidence is damning: secret correspondence with Austria, the flight to Varennes, the blood spilled at the Champ de Mars. Each accusation hangs heavy in the air.\n\nThe deputies debate with fierce intensity. Robespierre rises, his voice cold and measured: "Louis must die because the nation must live. There can be no compromise with tyranny." Saint-Just follows, declaring: "No man can reign innocently - every king is a rebel and a usurper." But others counsel restraint. Brissot argues for exile, while some Girondins speak of clemency and the preservation of France's reputation abroad.\n\nThe questioning continues for hours. Louis Capet, assisted by his defender Malesherbes, answers each charge with surprising composure. He does not rage or plead, but speaks with a quiet dignity that unsettles some in the assembly. When asked about the Austrian correspondence, he denies knowledge. When confronted with the flight to Varennes, he claims only to have sought safety for his family.\n\nFinally, as the interrogation draws to a close, the President of the Convention grants Louis permission to address the assembly one final time. A hush falls over the chamber. Louis rises slowly, his face pale but calm. His voice, though weaker than in his days of power, carries clearly through the hall:\n\n"Citizens... Representatives of France... I have loved the French people. Through all the years of my reign, whatever my errors of judgment may have been, I have sought their welfare and their happiness. I never imagined that I would stand here, accused of treason against those I have always considered my children." He pauses, his hands trembling slightly. "I am innocent of these charges. I have conspired with no foreign power. I have shed no blood willingly. If mistakes were made, they were the mistakes of circumstance and counsel, not of malice. I ask only that you judge me justly, as you would wish to be judged yourselves."\n\nThe hall remains silent as Louis takes his seat once more."

 france.2.t:0 "Hero Of Two Worlds"
 france.2.d:0 "The command tent at Sedan stood in oppressive silence as Lieutenant General Lafayette faced his assembled officers. Still wearing his blue uniform coat with gold épaulettes, the hero who had once commanded the National Guard of Paris. But his eyes carried the weight of a man whose world had collapsed.\n\n'Gentlemen,' Lafayette began, his voice steady but quiet, 'I must speak plainly. This government in Paris is illegitimate. It is illegal. On the tenth of August, a mob stormed the Tuileries Palace. They butchered the Swiss Guards. They imprisoned our King—the same King who granted us the constitution we swore to defend.'\n\nHe paused, gripping the edge of the map table. 'They have suspended the King's constitutional powers. They have torn apart the very document I helped create. The Declaration of the Rights of Man—my declaration—means nothing to them now. And they call me a traitor. Me. A traitor for remaining loyal to the constitution, to the King, to the principles of 1789.'\n\nHis voice grew harder. 'Paris says I am guilty of treason because I will not join their mob rule. Because I refuse to betray Louis XVI. Let them remember: without me, there would be no Declaration of Rights. Without me, there would be no constitutional monarchy to destroy. I gave France liberty, and they repay me with accusations and arrest warrants.'\n\nLafayette straightened, his decision made. 'I have no choice remaining. I will cross into the Austrian Netherlands. Any man who wishes to follow me may do so freely. Any man who wishes to stay and serve these... people... may remain. I have no authority to command you anymore. I can only ask.'\n\nWithout waiting for responses, Lafayette walked slowly from the tent. Outside, his horse waited, already saddled. He mounted in silence, his movements heavy with defeat. Behind him, the sound of boots—perhaps a dozen, perhaps twenty officers and men, gathering their horses, making their choice.\n\nAs Lafayette rode toward the border in the grey morning light, he did not look back at the camp, at the tricolor banners, at the army he had commanded. Some officers followed. Most did not. The hero of two revolutions departed France as a fugitive, choosing exile over betrayal of his principles.\n\nThe Revolution would not forgive him. History would struggle to understand him. But Lafayette rode on."
 france.2.a:0 "Good Bye..."
 france.500.a: "The Birth of the French Republic"
 france.500.b: "the National Convention assembled in the Tuileries Palace for what would become one of the most consequential sessions in the history of France. The air was thick with anticipation as deputy after deputy rose to speak, their voices united in a single purpose - the old order must fall, and a new age must dawn.\n\nWhen the motion was finally put forth, there was scarcely a moment's hesitation. By unanimous decree, the National Convention abolished the monarchy that had ruled France for centuries. In its place, they proclaimed the French Republic - the First Republic, born from the will of the people and the fire of revolution. The hall erupted into scenes of unbridled joy. Deputies embraced one another, tears streaming down their faces. From the galleries above, citizens cheered until their voices grew hoarse. Tricolor cockades were waved with fervor, and the cry of "Vive la République!" echoed through the ancient corridors.\n\nAmidst the celebration, a commanding figure rose from the benches of the Montagnards. Georges Jacques Danton, his broad shoulders and leonine features unmistakable even in the crowded chamber, stood waiting. His mere presence seemed to fill the room, and gradually, the tumult began to subside. Deputies turned to face him, their jubilation giving way to attentive silence. Even the galleries above grew quiet, sensing that something of great import was about to unfold.\n\nDanton's voice, powerful and resonant, carried to every corner of the hall: "Citizens! Representatives of the French people! Today we have struck down a tyrant and declared ourselves free men. But let us not forget - this Republic belongs not to us, but to the people of France!" He paused, his dark eyes sweeping across the assembly. "The Constitution we shall draft, the laws we shall write, the future we shall forge - all of this must bear the approval of those we represent. I propose, citizens, that when our Constitution is complete, it shall be submitted to the primary assemblies for popular ratification. Let every French citizen have his voice heard! Let the Republic be built not upon the authority of this Convention alone, but upon the sovereign will of the entire nation!"\n\nThe chamber erupted once more."
