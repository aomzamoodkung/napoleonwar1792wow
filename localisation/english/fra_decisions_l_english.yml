 FRA_create_cisalpine_republic: "Proclaim the Cisalpine Republic"
 FRA_create_cisalpine_republic_desc: "Northern Italy lies under French arms and French influence. By reorganising these lands into a sister republic, we can dress our domination in republican ideals, secure a loyal buffer state, and push the borders of the Revolution beyond the Alps."
 FRA_integrate_rhine_state: "Integrate the Rhine Territory"
 FRA_integrate_rhine_state_desc: "With resistance broken and compliance secured, this stretch of the Rhine can finally be bound to France in law and administration. Local privileges will be swept away, French institutions imposed, and the province turned from occupied land into an integral part of the Republic."
 FRA_integrate_savoy_state: "Integrate Savoy"
 FRA_integrate_savoy_state_desc: "The Alpine territories of Savoy have long been coveted by French kings and now lie within our grasp. These mountain passes control the routes between France and Italy, and their integration would fulfill the doctrine of natural frontiers—that France's borders should extend to the Rhine, the Alps, and the Pyrenees.\n\nSavoy's population, though historically loyal to the House of Savoy, has experienced French administration and revolutionary ideals. Full integration would grant them representation in the national Convention, extend republican laws throughout the region, and secure our southeastern flank permanently.\n\nWe must weigh the strategic advantages against potential diplomatic backlash. Annexation would be seen as naked imperialism by Austria and the Italian states, but it would give France the defensible borders that have eluded us for centuries."
